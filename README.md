## Getting Started

### Required Software
The LinuxForHealth pyConnect development environment requires the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com) for project version control
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local trusted certificates
- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) for runtime/coding support
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for a local container runtime

For Windows 10 users, we suggest using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

### Getting Started
#### Clone the project and navigate to the root directory
```shell
git clone https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/pyconnect
cd pyconnect
```

#### Create a virtual environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Install pyconnect with dev and test dependencies
```shell
pip install -e .[dev,test]
# note if using zsh shell the extra dependencies require quoting
# pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

#### Generate trusted local certs for pyConnect and supporting services

```shell
./local-certs/install-certificates.sh
```
For more information on pyConnect and HTTPS/TLS support, please refer to [the local cert readme](./local-certs/README.md).

#### Create Swarm Key for a private IPFS peer network
```shell
docker run --rm golang:1.9 sh -c 'go get github.com/Kubuxu/go-ipfs-swarm-key-gen/ipfs-swarm-key-gen && ipfs-swarm-key-gen'
/key/swarm/psk/1.0.0/
/base16/
f744ccf21ef090407977a33e01deb0a0c6a3397ae0366ff6f3c749e200f2510d
```
Persist the generated output (example above) to `./private-ipfs-network/.ipfs/swarm.key`

#### Create IPFS Cluster Secret (32-bit hex-encoded string) and update `CLUSTER_SECRET` in `docker-compose.yml`
```shell
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### Start supporting services and pyconnect
```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
LOCAL_CERTS_PATH=./local-certs \
  UVICORN_RELOAD=True \
  python pyconnect/main.py
```
- To add IPFS support use the `ipfs` profile.
```
docker-compose --profile ipfs up -d
```

### Docker Image
The pyconnect docker image is an "incubating" feature. The image builds successfully but additional work is required to
integrate certificates and supporting components such as NATS Jetstream, Kafka, etc.

#### Build the image
```shell
docker build --build-arg APPLICATION_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs -t linuxforhealth/pyconnect:0.25.0 .
```

#### Run the image
```shell
docker run linuxforhealth/pyconnect:0.25.0
```

## Getting Started

### Read the Documentation
The [LinuxForHealth documentation](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/docs/) includes architectural overviews, development guidelines, and deployment options.

### Required Software
The LinuxForHealth Connect development environment requires the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com) for project version control
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local trusted certificates
- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) for runtime/coding support
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io) for Python dependency management  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for a local container runtime

For Windows 10 users, we suggest using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

### Set Up A Local Environment
#### Clone the project and navigate to the root directory
```shell
git clone https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/connect
cd connect
```

#### Confirm that Python build tooling, pip and pipenv are installed
```shell
pip --version
pipenv --version
```

#### Install core and dev dependencies
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pipenv sync
```

#### Install git pre-commit hooks
```shell
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

Process registered with pre-commit hooks include: 
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) code formatter

#### Run tests
```shell
pipenv run pytest
```

#### Generate trusted local certs for connect and supporting services
```shell
./local-certs/install-certificates.sh
```
For more information on connect and HTTPS/TLS support, please refer to [the local cert readme](./local-certs/README.md).


#### Start connect and supporting services
```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
pipenv run connect
```

### Docker Image
The connect docker image is an "incubating" feature and is subject to change. The image is associated with the "deployment" profile to provide separation from core services.

#### Build the image
The connect image build integrates the application's x509 certificate (PEM encoded) into the image.

The `APPLICATION_CERT_PATH` build argument is used to specify the location of the certificate on the host machine.
If the `APPLICATION_CERT_PATH` build argument is not provided, a default value of ./local-certs/lfh.pem is used.

#### Build the image with Docker CLI
```shell
docker build --build-arg APPLICATION_BUILD_CERT_PATH=./local-certs/ -t linuxforhealth/connect:0.42.0 .
```

#### Build the image with Docker-Compose
The docker-compose command below parses the build context, arguments, and image tag from the docker-compose.yaml file.
```shell
docker-compose build connect
```

#### Run connect and Supporting Services
```shell
docker-compose --profile deployment up -d
```
